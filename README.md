# Neuromechanical model of C. Elegans

Original project:https://github.com/openworm/CyberElegans

Achieved with **unity3d**(5.6.2f1)

What's inside
-------------
- Build muscle and neuron in 3D modle.
- Connected neuron to muscle, and some neuron to neuron.
- Simulate muscle activity.(worm crawl)
- Simulate neurons activate muscle.(worm crawl)

-------------
**Control keys**:
```
	Camera:
		W / S: move forward / backward.
		A / D: move left / right.
		E / Q: move up / down.
		Shift / Space: speed up / down.
		Mouse right button: rotation angle.
	Worm:
		F1: show / hide infomations.
		F2: toggle gravity.
